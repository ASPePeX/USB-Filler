# USB-Filler

A tiny command line tool for copying files from a directory to multiple USB drives.

## Features
- Copies data simultaneously to all drives
- Up to 25 drives at once (as many as you have single letter drives)
- Repeat mode lets you go again with a single keypress (and counts for you)
- Verifies the written data with MD5
- Can format the drives before copying

## Support
